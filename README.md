# vanhackathon-my-best-helper

This app was craeted as part of the Vanhackathon that happened during the weekend of May 20-22, 2016.

## A Profile quiz prototype for MyBestHelper

I used https://robohash.org/ for the images... So you gotta use your imagination a litte bit for the options for every question :D

I stubbed the Api using Sinatra, and the repository can be found here: https://github.com/daividssilverio/sampleapis
